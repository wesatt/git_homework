First takeaway: Mod 0 is moving very fast and I definitely need to practice more outside of class
Second takeaway: My classmates are really amazing, intelligent people and the Slack channel is already a great place to collaborate

First strategy: Wake up earlier. I know this might not seem like a big deal, but my sleeping schedule is very out of whack and getting to bed earlier and waking up earlier will be immensely helpful to me for the rest of Mod 0 and for Mod 1
Second strategy: Add practice time to my calendar and practice more in general outside of class

Shoutout to Stirling for sharing the helpful Bash/Zsh commands list to Slack
Shoutout to Amanda, who clearly has good taste, for recognizing the David Bowie print behind me during an exercise
